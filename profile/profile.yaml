# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a data engineer and I enjoy solving complex problems. My journey into the software industry began in high school when I decided to take a coding course and discovered that I love to be challenged mentally and apply my skills instead of learning through methods that focus on just retaining and regurgitating knowledge from books and documents. From there I pursued my passion and my education, graduating from Seneca College in 2023 in Computer Programming and a Software Development Bootcamp at Brainstation. In my spare time, I work as a freelance programming tutor, helping college and university students with their assignments.

# List of Jarvis projects

  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VisaganShan/tree/main/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Implemented a monitoring agent that can track the hardware specifications and resource usage of machines in a Linux cluster and store the data inside a database. The application retrieved hardware specifications and resource usage by running bash scripts that used regex to retrieve relevant values and stored them in a postgreSQL database which was instaniated using Docker. Operations would be set to repeat on an interval that was set using crontab and the application was using virtual machine instances."
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "JDBC App: Established a stock market simulator that allows users to view, purchase, and sell stocks. Implemented using Java and operates by first retrieving a stock quote using the OkHttp library to retrieve values from the AlphaVantage Stock API, converting the retrieved JSON data into a Java object using Jackson library, and storing the object in a dockerized postgreSQL database which interacts with Data Access Layer (DAO objects) that was implemented to handle interactions between the application and the database. Service layer was implemented for business logic (stock quote lookup, buying & selling of a position) and interacts with the controller which provides a user interface allowing the user to interact with the application and perform service layer operations."
      - "Grep App: a command-line utility that searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and outputs matched lines to a file. Implemented using Core Java and its features such as Lambda, Stream and Regex and imported IO classes. Deployed using a fat JAR file, turned into a Docker Image and containizered the application."
