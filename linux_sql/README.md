# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent

## Introduction
The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent is a project created to retrieve a computer / node's hardware specifications and monitor it's resource usage. This monitoring agent caters to users who have a linux cluster of nodes and would like to monitor a node's resource usage for future planning. Statistics given by the monitoring agent can benefit users through proactive response and data gathering which ultimately leads to optimized efficiency in performance and lower energy consumption in cluster systems.

In implementing this project, I have used technologies such as Bash, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Git and tested it using virtual machine instances running Rocky Linux on Google Cloud Platform(GCP).
